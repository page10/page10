### 🕹My Games
I've published [my indie game on steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966190), _Blazing Crow_, it's a grid-based puzzle game, where you play as a crow to defeat humans.

Also, I make [small games on itch](https://page10.itch.io/), most of them have crow as their main character.
I really like those cute birds🦉.

### 💼Work Experiences
I worked in Funplus for a year, developed a [fighting game](https://glc.haowancheng.cn/fab) with more than 300 people in the development team👯.

Before that, I worked in Ourpalm, developed a [tower-defense game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bigbull.tdsgtw).

These word experiences are very useful to me, I learned a lot and had a joyful time developing game with those teams🥳.


### 🔭Plans and Horizon
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Northeastern University, with an expected graduation in June 2026.

I am passionate about continuing my career as a software engineer in the gaming industry.
